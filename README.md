* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Audiostack currently operates across all verticals but seems to have a focus in media.  Some big customers that stand out on their website include iHeart Media, Canva, Deloitte, and News Corp.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

While there are competitors that offer competitive products it is the the breadth and depth that AudioStack offers along with their focus on Security and protecting customer IP.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

AudioStack is currently using many different technologies but seems to have a reliance on AWS services as that is where they host their current platform.  In addition anyone who knows some Python or JavaScript and wants to create aprofessional-sounding audio in a matter of second can use AudioStack pretty easily.  AudtioStack also has a broad range of SDK's that can be used in development as well.


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

AI Audio Production

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

Overall AI/ML in Audio Production has been the trend.  Advancements in Speech Synthesis, Music Generation, Real-Time Processing, and Audio Editing has revolutionized various aspects of audio production.  This is making it easier, faster, and more accessible for creators to produce high-quality audio content across different domains.

* What are the other major companies in this field?

Because of their breadth and depth finding exact matches is a bit difficult.  Included are companies that are mainly in AI for music.  These companies include Google, Bytedance, SoundHound, and Stability AI.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Over the last few years, the company has grown substantially as generative AI has gained global popularity. As a result, AudioStack’s customer base has started to shift. The company’s initial customers were publishers and is now starting to attract enterprise and scale-up organizations. Additionally, the business now has reached a global audience, particularly seeing interest in the U.S. market. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

I have not been able to find a ton of information on this but in their Blog Post that make mention of DAU ( Daily Active Users) and why it is important.  You can visit the [How to Increase User Engagement](https://audiostack.ai/posts/how-to-increase-user-engagement-for-you-app-using-audio) page for more information.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

AudioStack is currently experiencing great success with new customers and global reach for their product.  They are working on delveloping new tools focused on additional features and time savings for their customer base.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Many new development companies are offering GUI based coding products.  While the lift is not that heavy to use AudioStack if they could remove some of the requirements around Python or JavaScript they may be able increase their user base even more for recreational purposes.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

More users which could mean more monetization for the company.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

This may have to be a homegrown item or it could be cheaper to implement your own UI/UX for this.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Iteration on the next step and product.
